# NIGHT Token Miner

High-performance automated miner for the NIGHT Token Scavenger Mine program.

**⚠️ Notice**: This software is provided as-is. Use at your own risk. To use this miner, you must agree to the terms and conditions displayed.

## Installation

**Download the Binary**
- Download `night-miner.zip` from the releases page
- Extract to a folder where you want to mine
- Windows only (`.exe` file)

## How to Use

### 1. Start Mining

**Easy Way - Double-click:**
- Simply double-click `night-miner.exe` in Windows Explorer
- Uses all CPU cores by default

**Advanced - PowerShell (for custom thread count):**
```powershell
.\night-miner.exe --threads 8
```

### 2. Accept Terms

On first run, you'll see:
- Official NIGHT Token End-User Terms
- Developer Contribution Agreement

Type `agree` to continue or `decline` to exit.

### 3. Mining Starts Automatically

The miner will:
- Find an unused developer address for you (from embedded pool)
- Create wallet addresses as needed
- Register addresses automatically
- Mine continuously
- Rotate addresses when needed (1 solution per address per challenge)

### 4. That's It!

Just leave it running. The miner handles everything automatically.

## Securing Your Addresses

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Backup Your Wallet

**Your `auto-mine-wallet/` folder contains the keys to claim your rewards!**

If you lose this folder, **you lose access to your rewards permanently**.

### What to Backup

```
auto-mine-wallet/
├── wallet.json           # List of all your addresses
├── wallet-stake.skey     # Shared stake key
├── wallet-stake.vkey     # Shared stake verification key
├── addr-*.skey           # Payment keys (CRITICAL - needed to claim rewards)
├── addr-*.vkey           # Payment verification keys
├── addr-*.addr           # Address files
├── .priority             # Your assigned developer address (obfuscated)
└── .agreement            # Terms agreement record
```

### Backup Schedule

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** The miner creates new addresses ON THE FLY as it mines!

**Your first backup will be nearly empty.** After several challenges (hours), you'll have many addresses.

**Why this matters:**
- Hour 1: You might have 5 addresses
- Hour 10: You might have 30 addresses  

It depends on how successful the miner is in any particular challenge!

**Backup Strategy:**
1. ✅ **Let the miner run for at least 2-4 hours first** (so addresses are created)
2. ✅ **Then do your first backup** (now you have something worth backing up!)
3. ✅ **Backup regularly after that** (if new addresses are created)
4. ✅ **Backup before stopping the miner** (capture all addresses)
5. ✅ **Store backups in a safe location**

**Don't backup immediately!** Wait until the miner has created addresses during actual mining challenges.

### Simple Backup Command

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse "auto-mine-wallet" "backup-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd-HHmm')"
```

### Claiming Rewards Later

When the claiming period opens, you'll need:
1. The `addr-*.skey` files to sign transactions
2. The `wallet.json` to know which addresses have rewards
3. Import keys into Eternl wallet or use Cardano CLI to claim

**Without these files, you cannot claim your rewards!**

## Mining

### What Happens When You Mine

1. **Developer Address** - First solution goes to developer (your compensation for this software)
2. **Your Addresses** - Following solutions go to your generated addresses
3. **Automatic Rotation** - Each address submits 1 solution per challenge, then rotates to next
4. **Continuous Mining** - Miner runs 24/7 creating new addresses as needed

### Example Output

Mining with generated address 0: addr1qywn...
⛏️  Mining...
✅ Solution found! Nonce: 0100019a470bb2e7 | Time: 14.14s
✅ Solution submitted successfully!
```

## FAQ

### Can I stop and restart?
Yes! The miner saves its progress. Just restart with the same command.

### How many addresses will be created?
As many as needed. The miners can typically create 30+ addresses over a single challenge period, but it depends on difficulty and CPU power.

### What if I lose the auto-mine-wallet folder?
**You permanently lose access to all rewards.** This is why regular backups are critical!

### How do I claim rewards later?

Keep every `addr-*.skey` file safe. This build mines exclusively for your configured wallet and no longer exposes donation or consolidation tooling. When you're ready to claim rewards, import the keys into a wallet such as Eternl or sign transactions manually with `cardano-cli`.

**Important:** Back up the entire `auto-mine-wallet/` directory regularly. These keys are the only way to recover mined rewards.
